# ShoppingCartProject

Developed a Java CLI shopping cart application demonstrating key OOP principles such as encapsulation and modular design. The system allows users to add products, remove them, and adjust quantities seamlessly while maintaining an accurate total price.

Implemented efficient data management using collections to track products and their quantities. This project strengthened practical Java skills by building an interactive console app with clear, maintainable code structure.
